# Java-DSA

This repository contains Java programs related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes various implementations of algorithms, data structures, recursion, file handling, and Java streams.

## Repository Contents

- **Recursion**: Programs that demonstrate recursive approaches (e.g., factorial, tower of hanoi).
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of stacks, arrays, and linked lists.
- **Java Streams**: Programs using Java Stream API for filtering, sorting, and parallel processing.
- **File Handling**: Code demonstrating reading and writing files in Java.
- **Threads**: Programs showcasing multithreading in Java.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Example implementations of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various Java concepts like String comparison, StringBuilder, and custom implementations of different data structures.

## Files Overview

- `AddRecurs.java`: Example of a recursive method.
- `ArrayInitialization.java`: Demonstrates array initialization.
- `FilterStream.java`: A program using Java streams to filter data.
- `FactRecur.java`: A recursive approach to calculating factorial.
- `MonotonicIncreasingStack.java`: Implementation of a monotonic stack.
- `ThreadJava.java`: Example of working with threads in Java.
- `WriteInFile.java`: Demonstrates writing data to a file.
